Chapter 37 - Advanced Configuration and Power Interface

I am not even going to pretend the ACPI is good. It may be modern and "advanced",
but for the most part it's needlessly complex. If we ever want to turn off the
computer, we'll have to use ACPI. But for now, we'll only use it to get some
ACPI tables that inform us about the hardware (such as the APICs).
If you wanna blame someone for this mess, blame Microsoft.
