Chapter 20 - VESA VBE

For now, we have been using VGA graphics to show the user text,
but we were limited to 16 specific colors in a specific font.
By using VESA graphics, we get a framebuffer where we can actually
set each pixel to an RGB color, giving us a great deal of control.
Furthermore, now that we have a basic VFS, we can load a font file
and use this to keep showing text, with the addition of images now
too.
