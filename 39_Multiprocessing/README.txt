Chapter 39 - Multiprocessing

A CPU does one thing at a time, so our OS does one thing at a time. To do multiple things
at the "same" time, we switch inbetween them very quickly. But this still means that we
get 1 CPU second per second. Sounds logical. But what if we had multiple CPUs? Then we
could have N CPU seconds per second. This is called multiprocessing, and your OS probably
does it. So let's do it too!
