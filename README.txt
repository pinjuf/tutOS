Pinjuf's programming prescriptions a.k.a the "credits":
    1) Your new bible is "Just For Fun".
    2) Your new bible is Intel Syntax Assembly.
    3) Your new bible is the OSDev wiki.
    4) Your new bible is Ralf Brown's interrupt list.
    5) Your new bible is The C Programming Language.
    6) Your new friends don't exist.
    7) If you don't understand something and I don't explain it,
          google/ddg it. DON'T REFUSE UNDERSTANDING!
    8) Write down EVERYTHING! What every few lines do, your memory layout, etc.!
    9) You're not hallucinating, Terry A. Davis really is talking to you, and you definitively should mess with the glowies!
