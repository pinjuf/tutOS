Chapter 11 - Mouse Driver

A PS/2 mouse driver shouldn't be a priority for your OS. But if
you wanna look cool, there's no better way than to do write one.
It's not very difficult, but can be pretty useful. (if you are
a non-keyboard-elitist stuck at the brain capacity and social
competence of a Hallucigenia)

FAQ:
    1) What are these QEMU audio options?
        They replace the old -soundhw pcspk (that I honestly
        prefer), and allow us to play sound via the PIT, channel
        2. But this is a story for later.
